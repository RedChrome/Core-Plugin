PDT Extensions Group / Core Plugin
==================================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pdt-eg/Core-Plugin.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pdt-eg/Core-Plugin)

The PDT extension group is a collobaration of PDT plugin maintainers to build a central PDT extension platform and codebase.

Currently the core plugin supports following features:

- [PHP Coding Standard Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) integration

We are in the process of migrating general functionality of our plugins into the core plugin, and add more core features for
other PDT extenders.

Join our [mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/pdt-extensions-platform) if you are interested in the discussion or want to help improve the PDT ecosystem.
